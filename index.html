<br>In my analysis, I want to analyse the narrative devices and other techniques used in "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker" that drive the emotions of the story and compare them with Massumi's take on "aspect vs. emotion".</br>
<br> To do this, I want to examine a cutscene that takes place early in the game, depicting the key event that sets the story in motion. </br>

  <br>This clip shows the protagonist of the game, Link, seeing his younger sister, Aryll, from across a bridge. As Aryll crosses the bridge to meet with her brother, however, a giant bird creature swoops down and steals her away, flying off into the distance.</br>
 <br> Massumi categorizes affect and emotion as two distinct, but connected phenomena--affect as an instinctual, visceral reaction, and emotion as a more categorized, processed response.
