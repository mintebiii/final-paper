<br>In my analysis, I want to analyse the narrative devices and other techniques used in "The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker" that drive the emotions of the story. To do this, I want to examine a cutscene that takes place early in the game, depicting the key event that sets the story in motion. </br>
