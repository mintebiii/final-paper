 The Wind Waker & The Call To Action</head>
<body>

<br>In my analysis, I want to explore some concepts in <i>The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker</i>, using the lens of Massumi's take on "aspect vs. emotion" as well as Althusser's concept of "hailing". </br>

  <br>In this clip, Link sees his younger sister, Aryll, from across a bridge, waving. Prior events in the game have built up the relationship between them as a strong sibling bond. As Aryll crosses the bridge to meet with her brother, however, a giant bird creature swoops down out of nowhere and steals her away, flying off into the distance.</br>
 <br> Massumi categorizes affect and emotion as two distinct, but connected phenomena--affect as an instinctual, visceral reaction, and emotion as a more categorized, processed response. This cutscene portrays both affect and emotion in action, and how they intertwine to create a very strong motivation for both the main character and the player.
