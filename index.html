<p class="big">
<br>In my analysis, I want to explore some concepts in <i>The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker</i>, using the lens of Massumi's take on "aspect vs. emotion" as well as Althusser's concept of "hailing". Below is the cutscene that I'd like to focus on, that depicts the inciting incident of the game. To provide some context, the protagonist, Link, lives on a remote island with his younger sister, Aryll, and their grandma. Pay attention to the score of this scene: it starts off with a wind instrument playing <i>Aryll's Theme</i>, a short motif that is repeated throughout the scene. </br>

  <br>As you saw, Aryll was kidnapped by a large bird monster, never to be seen again (as far as Link knows). You can clearly see, both in Link's reactions as well as the music, his range of emotions during and after this event. </br>
 <br> Massumi categorizes affect and emotion as two distinct, but connected phenomena--affect as an instinctual, visceral reaction, and emotion as a more categorized, processed response. Link's reaction portrays the concepts of both affect and emotion, and how they intertwine to create a very strong motivation for both the main character and the player.
