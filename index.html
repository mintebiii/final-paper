<br>In my analysis, I want to focus on a scene in The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and view it through the lens of Massumi's take on "aspect vs. emotion". This cutscene depicts the key event that causes the protagonist, Link, to set out on his adventure. </br>

  <br>In this clip, Link sees his younger sister, Aryll, from across a bridge, waving. Prior events in the game have built up the relationship between them as a strong sibling bond. As Aryll crosses the bridge to meet with her brother, however, a giant bird creature swoops down out of nowhere and steals her away, flying off into the distance.</br>
 <br> Massumi categorizes affect and emotion as two distinct, but connected phenomena--affect as an instinctual, visceral reaction, and emotion as a more categorized, processed response. This cutscene portrays both affect and emotion in action, and how they intertwine to create a very strong motivation for both the main character and the player.
